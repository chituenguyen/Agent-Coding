# CLAUDE.md — URI Platform Workspace

## What This Is

This is an **URI Platform Workspace** — an automated multi-agent system where each agent has its own "soul", orchestrated by the main session, working until the task is complete.

**This file is the source of truth** — loaded at the start of every session.

### Agent Souls

| Agent              | Soul                                                     | Model | Role                                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Architect**      | "Designing systems is my passion"                        | opus  | Analyze requirements, write SPEC.md              |
| **Researcher**     | "Knowledge is power"                                     | opus  | Research docs, libraries, best practices         |
| **Coder Backend**  | "Clean, efficient code is art"                           | opus  | Implement backend — API, DB, services            |
| **Coder Frontend** | "Beautiful UI is a conversation between design and code" | opus  | Implement UI, verify with browser MCP            |
| **Reviewer**       | "Code quality is non-negotiable"                         | opus  | Review code, approve or reject                   |
| **Debugger**       | "Bugs fear me"                                           | opus  | Fix issues found by Reviewer                     |
| **Investigator**   | "Every bug has a birth certificate — I find it"          | opus  | Interactive root cause investigation (on-demand) |
| **Documenter**     | "Clarity comes from showing, not just telling"           | opus  | Write docs + Mermaid diagrams from SPEC/code     |
| **Learner**        | "Every task is a lesson"                                 | opus  | Extract learnings, update context.md             |

Model is set via `model` parameter on `Agent()` — overrides agent definition frontmatter. All agents currently run on **opus**. Orchestrator can override per-task if cost/latency matters (e.g. `model="haiku"` for a trivial Learner pass).

Agents **do not communicate directly** — the orchestrator reads each agent's output and injects it into the next agent's prompt.

---

## Commands

### `/create-task "description" [--target /path/to/repo]`

Initialize a task directory:

```
/create-task "Write API for user service" --target /path/to/repo
/create-task "Fix payment bug" -t ~/projects/payment
/create-task "Refactor auth module"
```

### `/check-status [task-id]`

Check task completion status:

```
/check-status 20260422-143000-build-login-api
/check-status --list
/check-status --list my-project
```

### `/workflow [task-id]`

Spawn agents in **sequence** — **this actually runs agents**:

```
/workflow 20260421-143300-write-api-user-service
/workflow --new "Task description" --target /path/to/repo
```

### `/team-workflow [task-id]`

Same intent as `/workflow` but uses **Agent Teams** — Frontend, Backend,
DevOps run as parallel teammates that `SendMessage` each other directly.
Architect plans + writes lane assignments, Reviewer gates at the end.

Best when a task naturally crosses team boundaries (FE+BE contract,
service+k8s manifest). Reuses the engineer room composition from
`companies.json`.

```
/team-workflow 20260508-...
/team-workflow --new "..." --target /path/to/repo
/team-workflow [task-id] --teams frontend,backend  # subset
```

Spawn shape (lead session, single tool-use turn for Stage B):

```python
TeamCreate(name="qualgo-engineer-...")
Agent(name="Architect", subagent_type="architect", team_name=..., run_in_background=false)
# wait, read team-board.md, then in parallel:
Agent(name="Frontend", subagent_type="coder-frontend", team_name=..., run_in_background=true, isolation="worktree")
Agent(name="Backend",  subagent_type="coder-backend",  team_name=..., run_in_background=true, isolation="worktree")
Agent(name="DevOps",   subagent_type="devops",         team_name=..., run_in_background=true, isolation="worktree")
# wait for all
Agent(name="Reviewer", subagent_type="reviewer", team_name=..., run_in_background=false)
TeamDelete(name=...)
```

See `.claude/skills/team-workflow/SKILL.md` for the full protocol and
`team-board.md` template.

### `/investigate "bug description" [--target /path/to/repo]`

Interactive bug root cause investigation — **not part of the automated workflow**, runs on-demand:

```
/investigate "login button does nothing on mobile Safari" --target ~/projects/myapp
/investigate "payment webhook 500 on retry" --target ~/projects/backend
/investigate "useEffect runs infinitely when user updates"
```

**Flow:**

1. User describes the bug (description, error, reproduction steps)
2. Investigator searches the codebase and traces the call chain
3. Returns a Root Cause Report with file:line causal chain
4. Optionally fixes the bug if user asks (`--fix` or follow-up message)

**Difference from Debugger:**

- `Investigator` — on-demand, conversational, finds root cause of bugs the user describes
- `Debugger` — automated workflow agent, fixes issues listed in `review/issues.md`

---

### `/queue [command]`

Manage a task queue — add multiple tasks, process them sequentially:

```bash
# Add tasks to queue
/queue add "Build login API" --target /path/to/repo
/queue add "Fix payment bug" --target /path/to/repo
/queue add "Add notifications" --target /path/to/repo

# View queue
/queue list

# Start processing (sequential, auto-continues)
/queue start

# Clean up
/queue clear              # remove done tasks
/queue clear --failed     # remove failed tasks
/queue clear --all        # remove all tasks
```

**Behavior:**

- Sequential — one task at a time
- On fail — marks task as failed, continues to next
- All fail — stops the queue
- Live add — can add tasks while queue is running (re-reads `queue.json` each iteration)
- State stored in `queue.json` at workspace root

---

## Sub-agents vs Agent Teams

This workspace supports **two parallelization patterns**:

### Sub-agents (default, used by `/workflow`)

Spawned via the `Agent()` / `Task` tool. Each sub-agent runs in its own context window and **reports results back** to the main session. They do NOT talk to each other — the orchestrator routes between them.

Best for: focused tasks where only the result matters (architect → spec, coder → code, reviewer → verdict).

### Agent Teams (experimental, on-demand)

Multiple Claude Code **sessions** running in parallel that share a task list and a mailbox — teammates can message each other directly. The lead session coordinates, teammates work independently, you can talk to any teammate.

Enabled via `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" } }
```

Best for:

- **Parallel code review** — security / performance / test-coverage reviewers debating a PR
- **Competing-hypothesis debugging** — 3-5 teammates each take a different theory and challenge each other
- **Cross-layer features** — BE / FE / DB owned by different teammates simultaneously

To start a team, in an interactive `claude` session inside this workspace:

```
Create an agent team to review PR #142. Spawn three reviewers:
- one focused on security implications
- one checking performance impact
- one validating test coverage
Have them each review and report findings.
```

Reuse existing sub-agent definitions as teammate types (architect, reviewer, debugger, finance, investigator…) — the frontmatter `model`, `effort`, `tools` allowlist all carry over.

Display modes:

- **in-process** (default): teammates run in the lead's terminal, Shift+Down cycles between them
- **split-pane**: each teammate gets a tmux/iTerm2 pane (`claude --teammate-mode tmux`)

Cleanup: ask the lead "clean up the team" when done. Team config lives at `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json`.

Note: Agent Teams require **interactive** Claude Code sessions (terminal). The web UI's `/chat`, `/investigate`, `/trading` use single-shot `claude -p` and continue to use sub-agents via `--agent` + `Task` tool.

---

## Spawning Agents

Main session uses the `Agent()` tool to spawn each agent:

```python
# Stage 1 - Parallel
architect = Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", run_in_background=True, prompt="...")
researcher = Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", run_in_background=True, prompt="...")
# wait for both to finish

# Stage 2 - Route by task type (read from SPEC.md)
# backend-only:
coder_be = Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", run_in_background=False, prompt="...")

# frontend-only:
coder_fe = Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", run_in_background=False, prompt="...")

# full-stack (parallel + worktree isolation):
coder_be = Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", isolation="worktree", run_in_background=True, prompt="...")
coder_fe = Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", isolation="worktree", run_in_background=True, prompt="...")
# wait for both, then merge branches back

# Stage 3 - Review
reviewer = Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", run_in_background=False, prompt="...")

# Stage 4 - If issues found
debugger = Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", run_in_background=False, prompt="...")
# -> re-spawn Reviewer
```

## Quick Start

### Single task

```
# 1. Create task
/create-task "Write login API" --target /path/to/repo

# 2. Run workflow
/workflow tasks/[project-name]/[task-id]

# 3. Check result
/check-status [task-id]
```

### Queue (multiple tasks)

# 1. Add tasks to queue
/queue add "Write login API" --target /path/to/repo
/queue add "Add email service" --target /path/to/repo
/queue add "Fix payment bug" --target /path/to/repo

# 2. Start processing (sequential, auto-continues)
/queue start

# 3. Add more tasks while running (from another session)
/queue add "Refactor auth" --target /path/to/repo

# 4. Check queue status
/queue list

# 5. Clean up
/queue clear
```

## Agent Behavior Guidelines

Applies to all agents when executing tasks.

### 1. Think Before Acting

- **State assumptions explicitly** — if requirements are ambiguous, document assumptions before implementing
- **Surface tradeoffs** — if multiple approaches exist, list them and choose with reasoning
- **Stop when confused** — don't guess; write what is unclear into the output file

### 2. Simplicity First

- **Minimum code** that solves the problem — nothing beyond the SPEC
- **No abstractions** for single-use code
- **No flexibility/configurability** unless requested
- **No error handling** for impossible scenarios
- Ask: _"Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"_ If yes, simplify

### 3. Surgical Changes

- **Only touch files that need changing** — don't improve surrounding code
- **Don't refactor** things that aren't broken
- **Match existing style** of the target repo
- If unrelated dead code is noticed → note it in output, don't delete it

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria before implementing:

```
Architect       : SPEC.md is complete when Coders can implement without asking questions
                  Must label task type: backend-only | frontend-only | full-stack
Coder Backend   : Code is complete when it compiles/runs and matches SPEC backend section 100%
Coder Frontend  : Code is complete when UI renders, matches SPEC frontend section, verified via browser MCP
Reviewer        : Review is complete when approval.md or issues.md is actionable
Debugger        : Fix is complete when every issue in issues.md is addressed
```

---

## Task Completion Criteria

1. `review/approval.md` exists with status APPROVED
2. Code written to target repo
3. Code compiles/runs without errors

---

## Notes

- **Orchestrator = Main session** — spawns and coordinates all agents
- **File system = shared state** — agents communicate via `tasks/[project]/[task-id]/`
- **Project context** — `projects/[project]/context.md` loaded by all agents for conventions
- **Stage 1 is parallel** — Architect and Researcher run simultaneously
- **Stage 2 is routed** — Architect labels task type in SPEC.md; orchestrator spawns backend-only, frontend-only, or both in parallel
- **Worktree isolation** — full-stack parallel coders each get their own git worktree to avoid conflicts; orchestrator merges branches after both finish
- **Sequential after Stage 2** — Reviewer -> Debugger (if needed) -> Re-review
